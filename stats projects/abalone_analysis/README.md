# Abalone Age Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive statistical analysis of abalone age prediction based on physical characteristics. The study utilizes linear regression models to establish relationships between various physical attributes of abalones and their age, as indicated by the number of rings.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Development of multiple linear regression models
- Model selection and comparison using ANOVA
- Implementation of interaction terms to capture complex relationships
- Model diagnostics and validation
  
## Files
- `abalone.txt`: Dataset with physical measurements of abalones.
- `abalone_analysis.R`: R script for data analysis.
- `abalone_analysis_report.pdf`: Detailed analysis report.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have the necessary R libraries installed:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "patchwork", "ggcorrplot", "MASS"))
    ```
2. Run the R script to perform the analysis:
    ```R
    source('abalone_analysis.R')
    ```
3. Refer to the report for detailed insights and conclusions from the analysis.
