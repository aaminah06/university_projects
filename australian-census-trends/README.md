# Australian Census Trends Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes trends in Australian Census data from 1996 to 2021, focusing on income distribution across different gender groups. The analysis aims to explore the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in the distribution of income categories among different gender groups during this period.

## Data
The data used in this project comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census. It includes:
- Census data for Western Australia from 1996 to 2021
- Focus on Local Government Areas (LGA) for 2011-2021 data
- Weekly personal income data by gender

Data files are located in the `data/` directory.

## Report and Code
The full analysis, including all code, methodology, results, and discussion, is contained in the `Australian_Trends_Report.pdf` file. This comprehensive document includes:
- Detailed methodology
- Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Visualizations and their interpretations
- Discussion of results
- Limitations of the analysis
- Conclusions and implications of the findings

## Key Findings
- Persistent gender gap in income distribution from 1996 to 2021
- Higher representation of women in lower income brackets
- Increasing representation of men in higher income brackets over time
- Widening of the gender pay gap, especially after 2001

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: csv, numpy, re, matplotlib

## How to Run
As the code is embedded within the report, to replicate the analysis:
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (csv, numpy, re, matplotlib).
2. Extract the code sections from the `Australian_Trends_Report.pdf`.
3. Run the extracted code using a Python environment of your choice.
